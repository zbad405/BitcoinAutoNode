ZetacoinAutoNode
===============

A script to run (ideally just after starting up a new server/vps) to automatically setup zetacoind and have it start on boot.

One Liner
---------

    wget -O zetNode.sh https://raw.github.com/zbad405/ZetacoinAutoNode/master/zetacoinAutoNode.sh ; sudo bash zetNode.sh
    
You should really check out the code before running that though.
